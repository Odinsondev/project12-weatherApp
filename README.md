# project12-weatherApp

My twelfth Odin project - Weather App

I'm going to use everything Iâ€™ve learned about APIs and asynchronous code
to create a weather forecast site using the weather API.
It should be able to search for a specific location
and toggle displaying the data in Fahrenheit or Celsius.
